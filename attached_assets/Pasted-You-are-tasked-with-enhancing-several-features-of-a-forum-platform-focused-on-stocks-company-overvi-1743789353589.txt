You are tasked with enhancing several features of a forum platform focused on stocks, company overviews, and various discussion topics such as finance, economy, politics, and news.

Please address each of the following tasks:

1. **Enhancing the Graphs of Stocks**:
   - Develop an interactive and visually appealing interface for displaying stock performance.
   - Features should include the ability to zoom in/out, hover over data points for more details, and toggle between different time frames (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year).
   - Use clear lines, distinguishable colors, and smooth animations to ensure the graphs are attractive and easy to read.
   - Include detailed information such as stock prices, volume traded, and important financial events annotated on the graph.

2. **Improving Company Overviews**:
   - Generate detailed and engaging company overviews including:
     - **Company Background**: A brief history and primary business activities.
     - **Financial Summary**: Key financial metrics such as revenue, profit, market capitalization, and stock performance.
     - **Recent News**: Summarize recent news articles or press releases related to the company.
     - **Future Outlook**: Provide analysis of the company's future growth prospects and potential challenges.
     - **Visuals**: Incorporate relevant charts, graphs, or images to make the overview more engaging.

3. **Creating and Enhancing Forum Pages**:
   - Design a forum page structure similar to Reddit but focused on finance, economy, politics, and news.
   - Create categories such as Finance, Economy, Politics, and News.
   - Include sub-categories within each topic to allow for more specific discussions.
   - Enable users to create posts and comment on them.
   - Add "like" functionalities allowing users to like posts and comments.
   - Ensure the posterâ€™s name and profile information are visible with each post or comment.

4. **Language Filter for Insulting Content**:
   - Integrate an AI-based language filter to prevent insulting or inappropriate content in forum posts and comments.
   - The filter should detect and flag offensive language using natural language processing.
   - Provide warnings to users attempting to post flagged content, suggesting revisions or blocking the post if necessary.
   - Consider the context to avoid false positives, ensuring relevant discussions are not wrongly flagged.
   - Display clear guidelines about acceptable language and behavior in the forums (e.g., "Your post contains language that may be considered offensive. Please revise your content to adhere to community guidelines.").
