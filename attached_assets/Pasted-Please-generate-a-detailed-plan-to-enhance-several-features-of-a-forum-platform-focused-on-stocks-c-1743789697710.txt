Please generate a detailed plan to enhance several features of a forum platform focused on stocks, company overviews, and various discussion topics such as finance, economy, politics, and news. Address each of the following tasks:

Enhancing the Graphs of Stocks:

Develop an interactive and visually appealing interface for displaying stock performance.
Features should include the ability to zoom in/out, hover over data points for more details, and toggle between different time frames (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year).
Use clear lines, distinguishable colors, and smooth animations to ensure the graphs are attractive and easy to read.
Include detailed information such as stock prices, volume traded, and important financial events annotated on the graph.
Improving Company Overviews:

Generate detailed and engaging company overviews including:
Company Background: A brief history and primary business activities.
Financial Summary: Key financial metrics such as revenue, profit, market capitalization, and stock performance.
Recent News: Summarize recent news articles or press releases related to the company.
Future Outlook: Provide an analysis of the company’s future growth prospects and potential challenges.
Visuals: Incorporate relevant charts, graphs, or images to make the overview more engaging.
Creating and Enhancing Forum Pages:

Design a forum page structure similar to Reddit but focused on finance, economy, politics, and news.
Create categories such as Finance, Economy, Politics, and News.
Include sub-categories within each topic to allow for more specific discussions.

Add “like” functionalities allowing users to like posts and comments.
Ensure the poster’s name and profile information are visible with each post or comment.
Language Filter for Insulting Content:

Integrate an AI-based language filter to prevent insulting or inappropriate content in forum posts and comments.
The filter should detect and flag offensive language using natural language processing.
Provide warnings to users attempting to post flagged content, suggesting revisions or blocking the post if necessary.
Consider the context to avoid false positives, ensuring relevant discussions are not wrongly flagged.
Display clear guidelines about acceptable language and behavior in the forums (e.g., “Your post contains language that may be considered offensive. Please revise your content to adhere to community guidelines.”).
Additional Features:

Add contextual financial tips based on a user’s portfolio.
Add a personalized financial learning path with gamified progress tracking.
Ensure financial indicators work properly.
Ensure that graphs are functioning correctly.
